## 2026-10-29 — UC-35 / UC-36 relocation source and planning guard

- WAREHOUSE_TASK details add optional sourceBalanceId, sourceBalanceVersion and ownerPartyId. New UC-36 tasks always record them; existing tasks remain readable. No quantity or reservation is changed on creation.
- Location adds planningVersion (default 0) to serialize overlapping task planners. Existing rows acquire it on the first guarded write; no bulk migration or new collection/index is required. Future stocktake/task/posting writers must share this guard.
- API and verification contract: [location movements](../modules/location-movements/README.md).
